We will also learn about the message ordering and deadlock properties of MPI programs.  Non-blocking communications are an interesting extension of point-to-point communications, since they can be used to avoid delays due to blocking and to also avoid deadlock-related errors.

An analogous approach can also be used to combine MPI and multithreading, so as to improve the performance of distributed MPI applications.  Distributed actors serve as yet another example of combining distribution and multithreading.  A notable property of the actor model is that the same high-level constructs can be used to communicate among actors running in the same process and among actors in different processes; the difference between the two cases depends on the application configuration, rather the application code.

Object-based isolation relaxes the constraints imposed by critical sections by allowing mutual exclusion to be specified on a per-object basis, as illustrated in the Spanning Tree example.

However, as in all concurrent programming models, higher-level forms of nondeterminism are still possible in the Actor model due to an inherent asynchrony in the order in which messages may be delivered.

We will then study the widely-used Concurrent Queue data structure.  Even though the APIs for using concurrent queues are very simple, their implementations using the Optimistic Concurrency model can be complex and error-prone.   To that end, we will also learn the formal notion of Linearizability to better understand correctness requirements for concurrent data structures.

Following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change off the output with respect to an input. Using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions. Finally, by studying a few examples, we develop four handy time saving rules that enable us to speed up differentiation for many common scenarios. ",

The lesson begins with instructions on installing the popular Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes Spyder. It continues by showing how to use  the editor in Spyder to type in a function and then run it. Each lesson alternates between introducing a concept by example and having the student test his\/her understanding by constructing a function similar to that example.  The module lecture is contained in a single program source file named Exercises1.py. This file, which should be downloaded by the student at the beginning of the module, contains the complete lecture except the solutions to the ungraded exercises. The student should work each of these before viewing the instructor's solution. By using the unique capability of Spyder (using IPython Notebooks), the program file is segmented into cells each of which can be executed independently of the others. Thus the student does not have to manage multiple program files and finishes with a lecture file with filled-in student exercises that can be used for reference.  Python topics included in this module are print statement, arithmetic operators, input statement, combining of strings, if statement, while loop, and for loop.  The module ends with a series of small functions to write to be submitted for grading.

Lesson 2: This lecture teaches how to order multicasts in any distributed system. Algorithms for assigning timestamp tags to multicasts using various flavors of ordering \u2013 FIFO, Causal, and Total \u2013 are covered. The module also covers virtual synchrony, a paradigm that combines reliable multicasts with membership views.  Lesson 3: Consensus is one of the most important problems in a distributed system, enabling multiple machines to agree. This module uses Paxos, one of the most popular consensus solutions used in the industry today. Paxos is not perfect because consensus cannot be solved completely \u2013 an optional lecture presents the famous FLP proof of impossibility of consensus. ",

The users interact with the device in a natural way, similar to their interactions with any other objects in the world. In this way, an embedded system has an interface that conforms to the expectations and needs of the users. Establishing a natural interface requires that the embedded system interface with the physical world directly through sensors, which read the state of the world, and actuators, which change the state of the world. In this module we will discuss the structure of embedded systems and describe these interactions with the physical world.",

Until now we've mostly considered tests that require assumptions about the shape of the distribution (z-tests, t-tests and F-tests). Sometimes those assumptions don't hold. Non-parametric tests require fewer of those assumptions. There are several non-parametric tests that correspond to the parametric z-, t- and F-tests. These tests also come in handy when the response variable is an ordered categorical variable as opposed to a quantitative variable. There are also non-parametric equivalents to the correlation coefficient and some tests that have no parametric-counterparts.",

      "description": "Lasso regression analysis is a shrinkage and variable selection method for linear regression models. The goal of lasso regression is to obtain the subset of predictors that minimizes prediction error for a quantitative response variable. The lasso does this by imposing a constraint on the model parameters that causes regression coefficients for some variables to shrink toward zero. Variables with a regression coefficient equal to zero after the shrinkage process are excluded from the model. Variables with non-zero regression coefficients variables are most strongly associated with the response variable. Explanatory variables can be either quantitative, categorical or both. In this session, you will apply and interpret a lasso regression analysis. You will also develop experience using k-fold cross validation to select the best fitting model and obtain a more accurate estimate of your model\u2019s test error rate. \nTo test a lasso regression model, you will need to identify a quantitative response variable from your data set if you haven\u2019t already done so, and choose a few additional quantitative and categorical predictor (i.e. explanatory) variables to develop a larger pool of predictors.  Having a larger pool of predictors to test will maximize your experience with lasso regression analysis. Remember that lasso regression is a machine learning method, so your choice of additional predictors does not necessarily need to depend on a research hypothesis or theory. Take some chances, and try some new variables. The lasso regression analysis will help you determine which of your predictors are most important. Note also that if you are working with a relatively small data set, you do not need to split your data into training and test data sets. The cross-validation method you apply is designed to eliminate the need to split your data when you have a limited number of observations. ",

The goal of cluster analysis is to group, or cluster, observations into subsets based on their similarity of responses on multiple variables. Clustering variables should be primarily quantitative variables, but binary variables may also be included. In this session, we will show you how to use k-means cluster analysis to identify clusters of observations in your data set. You will gain experience in interpreting cluster analysis results by using graphing methods to help you determine the number of clusters to interpret, and examining clustering variable means to evaluate the cluster profiles. Finally, you will get the opportunity to validate your cluster solution by examining differences between clusters on a variable not included in your cluster analysis.  \nYou can use the same variables that you have used in past weeks as clustering variables. If most or all of your previous explanatory variables are categorical, you should identify some additional quantitative clustering variables from your data set. Ideally, most of your clustering variables will be quantitative, although you may also include some binary variables. In addition, you will need to identify a quantitative or binary response variable from your data set that you will not include in your cluster analysis. You will use this variable to validate your clusters by evaluating whether your clusters differ significantly on this response variable using statistical methods, such as analysis of variance or chi-square analysis, which you learned about in Course 2 of the specialization (Data Analysis Tools).

In statistics, moderation occurs when the relationship between two variables depends on a third variable. The effect of a moderating variable is often characterized statistically as an interaction; that is, a third variable that affects the direction and\/or strength of the relation between your explanatory (X) and response (Y) variable. Your task will be to test your own research question in the context of one or more potential moderating variables. ",

The concepts in this module will serve as building blocks for our later courses.<p>Each lesson comes with a set of learning objectives that will be covered in a series of short videos. Supplementary readings and practice problems will also be suggested from <a href=\"https:\/\/leanpub.com\/openintro-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition<\/a> (a free online introductory statistics textbook, that I co-authored). There will be weekly quizzes designed to assess your learning and mastery of the material covered that week in the videos. In addition, each week will also feature a lab assignment, in which you will use R to apply what you are learning to real data. There will also be a data analysis project designed to enable you to answer research questions of your own choosing.<p>Since this is a Coursera course, you are welcome to participate as much or as little as you\u2019d like, though I hope that you will begin by participating fully. One of the most rewarding aspects of a Coursera course is participation in forum discussions about the course materials. Please take advantage of other students' feedback and insight and contribute your own perspective where you see fit to do so. You can also check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/probability-intro\/resources\/crMc4\" target=\"_blank\">resource page<\/a> listing useful resources for this course. <p>Thank you for joining the Introduction to Probability and Data community!

The first clustering algorithm you will implement is k-means, which is the most widely used clustering algorithm out there.  To scale up k-means, you will learn about the general MapReduce framework for parallelizing and distributing computations, and then how the iterates of k-means can utilize this framework.

This represents both techniques specific to clustering and retrieval, as well as foundational machine learning concepts that are more broadly useful.<p>We provide a quick tour into an alternative clustering approach called hierarchical clustering, which you will experiment with on the Wikipedia dataset.  Following this exploration, we discuss how clustering-type ideas can be applied in other areas like segmenting time series.  We then briefly outline some important clustering and retrieval ideas that we did not cover in this course.<p> We conclude with an overview of what's in store for you in the rest of the specialization.

It's good to know this before trying to solve a problem before the tomorrow's deadline :) Although these problems are very unlikely to be solvable efficiently in the nearest future, people always come up with various workarounds. In this module you will study the classical NP-complete problems and the reductions between them.

However, don't give up yet! People are creative, and they need to solve these problems anyway, so in practice there are often ways to cope with an NP-complete problem at hand. We first show that some special cases on NP-complete problems can, in fact, be solved in polynomial time. We then consider exact algorithms that find a solution much faster than the brute force algorithm. We conclude with approximation algorithms that work in polynomial time and find a solution that is close to being optimal. ",

In many modern applications in big data analysis, however, the input is so large that it cannot be stored in memory. Instead,  the input is presented as a stream of updates, which the algorithm scans while maintaining a small summary of the stream seen so far. This is precisely the setting of the streaming model of computation, which we study in this lecture. The streaming model is well-suited for designing and reasoning about small space algorithms. It has received a lot of attention in the literature, and several powerful algorithmic primitives for computing basic stream statistics in this model have been designed, several of them impacting the practice of big data analysis. In this lecture we will see one such algorithm (CountSketch), a small space algorithm for finding the top k most frequent items in a data stream.",

Some in-video questions and practice quizzes will help you to review the material, with no effect on the final grade. A mandatory peer-graded assignment is also present, for weeks from 1 to 9, and it will expand on the lectures' topics, letting you reach a deeper understanding. The nine peer-graded assignments will make up for 50% of the grade, while the other half will come from a final exam, after the last lecture.\n<br>\nIn this first week, we will learn about algorithms by playing with a pebble on the Monte Carlo beach and at the Monaco heliport. In the tutorial we will use the 3x3 pebble game to understand the essential concepts of Monte Carlo techniques (detailed balance, irreducibility, and a-periodicity), and meet the celebrated Metropolis algorithm.

This leads us to adopt the stance of bioinspiration rather than biomimicry, i.e., extracting principles rather than appearances and applying them systematically to our machines. A little more thinking about typical animal mobility leads us to focus on appendages \u2013 limbs and tails \u2013 as sources of motion. The second portion of the week offers a bit of background on the physical and mathematical foundations of limbed robotic mobility. We start with a linear spring-mass-damper system and consider the second order ordinary differential equation that describes it as a first order dynamical system. We then treat the simple pendulum \u2013 the simplest revolute kinematic limb \u2013 in the same manner just to give a taste for the nature of nonlinear dynamics that inevitably arise in robotics. We\u2019ll finish with a treatment of stability and energy basins.\n\n Link to bibliography: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/robotics-mobility\/resources\/pqYOc ",

Sprawled posture runners like cockroaches have six legs which typically move in a stereotyped pattern which we will consider as a model for a hexapedal machine.  Nature\u2019s quadrupeds have their own varied gait patterns which we will match up to various four-legged robot designs as well. Finally, we\u2019ll consider bipedal machines, and we\u2019ll take the opportunity to distinguish human-like robot bipeds that are almost foredoomed to be slow quasi-static machines from a number of less animal-like bipedal robots whose embrace of bioinspired principles allows them to be fast runners and jumpers. \n\nLink to bibliography: https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/robotics-mobility\/resources\/pqYOc ",

The final section of this week\u2019s lesson brings you to the horizons of research into legged mobility.

We also cover the profiler in R which lets you collect detailed information on how your R functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed. The profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs. Finally, we cover the str function, which I personally believe is the most useful function in R.",

To address this problem, you'll explore more advanced shortest path algorithms.  First, you'll see how to find the shortest path on a weighted graph, then you'll see how to find it more quickly.

You will learn which indicators are included in the KOF YLMI and how these are aggregated into a single index. Furthermore, you will get to know an online tool that invites you to analyse the youth labour market situation yourself.\nIn the second lesson of this module, you will learn about the KOF Globalization Index which is a widely used composite indicator that measures the degree of globalization for every country in the world since 1970. It distinguishes between three dimensions of globalization: Economic, social and political globalization. In the following module, you will learn why it is important to measure globalization and what the different stages in constructing the KOF Globalization Index are.

We also cover the methodology to build both indices. We then discuss some stylized facts.\nThe second index presented this week is the Human Development Index (HDI) developed by UNDP. During this lesson, you will be slightly introduced with the history of the HDI. We explain the steps of constructing the HDI, i.e. choosing the three dimensions (health, education and living conditions) composing the HDI and their respective indicators, normalizing the indicators and aggregating the indicators and dimensional sub-indices using different methods. Then, we use a practical example to calculate the HDI for one country. At the end, we discuss some limitations of the HDI and give some elements for future improvement. \n",

For this reason, priority queues have built-in implementations in many programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python. We will see that these implementations are based on a beautiful idea of storing a complete binary tree in an array that allows to implement all priority queue methods in just few lines of code. We will then switch to disjoint sets data structure that is used, for example, in dynamic graph connectivity and image processing. We will see again how simple and natural ideas lead to an implementation that is both easy to code and very efficient.

A natural question to ask is whether there are \"fragile regions\" hidden in your genome where chromosome breakage has occurred more often over millions of years.

It is used to describe objects in terms of attributes they have. Derivation operators in a formal context link together object and attribute subsets; they are used to define formal concepts. They also give rise to closure operators, and we'll talk about what these are, too. We'll have a look at software called Concept Explorer, which is good for basic processing of formal contexts. We'll also talk a little bit about many-valued contexts, where attributes may have many values.

It was the beginning of the deadliest outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious bacterial strain that we will refer to as E. coli X. Within a few months, the outbreak had infected thousands and killed 53 people. To prevent the further spread of the outbreak, computational biologists all over the world had to answer the question \u201cWhat is the genome sequence of E. coli X?\u201d in order to figure out what new genes it acquired to become pathogenic. \nThe 2011 German outbreak represented an early example of epidemiologists collaborating with computational biologists to stop an outbreak. In this Genome Assembly Programming Challenge, you will follow in the footsteps of the bioinformaticians investigating the outbreak by developing a program to assemble the genome of the deadly E. coli X strain. However, before you embark on building a program for assembling the E. coli X strain, we have to explain some genomic concepts and warm you up by having you solve a simpler problem of assembling a small virus.",

By the late 1980s, biologists were routinely sequencing viral genomes containing hundreds of thousands of nucleotides, but the idea of sequencing a bacterial (let alone the human) genome containing millions (or even billions) of nucleotides remained preposterous and would cost billions of dollars.\nIn 1988, three biologists (independently and simultaneously!) came up with an idea to reduce sequencing cost and proposed the futuristic and at the time completely implausible method of DNA arrays. None of these three biologists could have possibly imagined that the implications of his own experimental research would eventually bring him face-to-face with challenging algorithmic problems. In this module you will learn about the algorithmic challenge of DNA sequencing using information about short k-mers provided by DNA arrays. You will also travel to the 18the century to learn about the Bridges of Konigsberg and solve a related problem of assembling a jigsaw puzzle!",
